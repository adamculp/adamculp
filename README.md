You can also find me at any of the resources I openly contribute to such as [Beachcasts](https://beachcasts.com), [Geekyboy Technical Blog](https://geekyboy.com), or [Run Geek Radio Podcast](https://rungeekradio.com). I'm an active user group organizer in South Florida for [SoFloPHP](https://soflophp.org) and [SoFloPy](https://soflopy.org), or the [SunshinePHP Developer Conference](https://sunshinephp.com) in Miami. I can also be found at [tech conferences](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLsiNQQ5_UdTtsIA0ayykwTLddkqvEwnpX) around the world spreading my passion for helping developers.

If you'd like me to speak for your usergroup or event, please feel free to reach out. I can be found easily on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/adamculp).
